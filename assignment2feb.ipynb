    "Tuple Characteristics and Immutability\n",
    "A tuple is an ordered, immutable, and heterogeneous collection of elements. Here are some key characteristics of tuples:\n",
    "• Order: Tuples are ordered collections of elements, meaning that the elements are stored in a specific order, and this order is preserved.\n",
    "• Immutability: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.\n",
    "• Heterogeneous elements: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, lists, and other tuples.\n",
    "• Indexing: Like lists, tuples can be accessed using indexing. You can retrieve elements of a tuple by using the square brackets [] and the index of the element you want to retrieve.\n",
    "• Iteration: You can iterate over the elements of a tuple using a for loop.\n",
    "• Named Tuples: Python provides a special class namedtuple() which can be used to give the tuple elements more meaningful names, rather than just using index numbers.\n",
    "In conclusion, tuples are a useful data structure for representing and manipulating small, fixed-size collections of ordered, immutable, and heterogeneous elements.\n",

    "The reason why tuples have only two built-in methods as compared to lists is that tuples are meant to be simple, fixed-size collections of elements. Tuples are often used to represent a small, fixed number of related values, such as the x, y, and z coordinates of a point in 3D space. The two built-in methods, count() and index(), are sufficient for most uses of tuples. On the other hand, lists are more flexible and intended for more complex data structures, and therefore have more built-in methods to support more advanced operations.\n",

    "# Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two collection datatypes that do not allow duplicate items: sets and dictionaries.\n",
    "• Sets: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined using curly braces {} or the set() function.\n",
    "If you try to add a duplicate item to a set, it will not change the set, since sets only store unique elements.\n",
    "• Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. It is defined using curly braces {}.\n",
    "If you try to add a duplicate key to a dictionary, it will overwrite the value associated with the previous key. Dictionaries only store one value for each unique key."
